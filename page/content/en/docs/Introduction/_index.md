    Intro and motivation for creating SeQuiLa.
---

SeQuiLa project was started at [Institute of Computer Science at Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.ii.pw.edu.pl/index.php/ii_eng/Inst.-of-Computer-Science) in late 2017.
The main goal of the project was to extend [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) with fast and scalable implementations of common bioinformatics operations
need for processing large next-generation sequencing datasets such as *interval joins*, *depth of coverage* or *pileup*.

If you are new to Apache Spark and distributed processing we highly recommend you to get started with great [Apache Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.2/).

Beware that SeQuiLa is *just* an extension to Apache Spark - the combination of two gives you almost unlimited analytical power to crunch NGS data at any scale!
